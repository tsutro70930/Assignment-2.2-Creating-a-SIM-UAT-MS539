You go to land but there is none, it is early morning and you hover low over the water then you see him man on the bow of a ship stretching in the fog.
Before he could have possible nocied you he looks suddenly his eyes flashing red with a look upon his face so severe it shakes you..you get the feeling that
if you leave his ship alone he will leave yours alone.
